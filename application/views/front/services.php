                A company is a legal entity formed by a group of individuals to engage
                in and operate a business—commercial or industrial—enterprise. A company
                may be organized in various ways for tax and financial liability purposes
                depending on the corporate law of its jurisdiction
                The line of business the company is in will generally determine which business
                structure it chooses such as a partnership, proprietorship, or corporation.
                These structures also denote the ownership structure of the company.
                They can also be distinguished between private and public companies. Both have different
                ownership structures, regulations, and financial reporting requirements.

                A company is essentially an artificial person—also known as corporate personhood—in
                that it is an entity separate from the individuals who own, manage, and support its operations.
                Companies are generally organized to earn a profit from business activities, though some may be
                structured as nonprofit charities. Each country has its own hierarchy of company and corporate
                structures, though with many similarities.
                A company has many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as a person does,
                like the ability to enter into contracts, the right to sue (or be sued), borrow money,
                pay taxes, own assets, and hire employees.</p>
